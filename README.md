## üìö Overview

**VM Bridge** is a custom-built Python tool designed to help teachers easily deploy, manage, and distribute virtual machines for students in a classroom environment using **Proxmox VE**.  
I created this project based on my own real experience ‚Äî I once struggled to afford a powerful PC for training labs. This tool makes it possible for teachers to handle all the heavy work on a Proxmox server and send each student their own VM access details.
