## üìö Overview

**VM Bridge** is a custom-built Python tool designed to help teachers easily deploy, manage, and share virtual machines for students in a classroom environment using **Proxmox VE**.

I created this project from my own real experience ‚Äî when I started my IT studies, my teachers asked us to buy powerful PCs for running multiple virtual machines. Many students, including myself, couldn‚Äôt afford expensive hardware. **VM Bridge** solves this problem by letting the teacher handle everything on the Proxmox server and distribute ready-to-use VMs to students with just a few clicks.
